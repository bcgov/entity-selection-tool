A benefit company, however, must have a 'benefit statement' in its Notice of Articles, and a 'benefit provision' in its Articles of Incorporation. The benefit provision states the public benefits, commits to promote those benefits, and outlines how the company will conduct business in a responsible and sustainable manner. A benefit company must also publish and post an annual benefit report, and the company's directors must balance their duty to act in the best interests of the company with their duty to promote the company's specified public benefits. A benefit company has all of the advantages (e.g., limited liability, lower corporate tax rates) and disadvantages (e.g., higher setup and ongoing costs) of a BC corporation.

As a legal business structure, a co-op can enter into contracts or take on debt in its own name with legal rights and obligations similar to those of an individual. Incorporating limits the liability of a co-op's members. There are several advantages to a co-op structure: members provide multiple sources of investment capital; managerial and operational duties are shared; there are potential cost savings for members; and a co-op can build a sense of community through shared purpose. The main disadvantages are that it is often more complex and costly to set-up than a corporation, decision-making can sometimes be slow or challenging, and it can be difficult to raise large amounts of capital.",
