As a sole proprietor, you do whatever is required for successful operation of your business. You make decisions, receive all profits, and claim all losses. Although you may hire employees to assist you, you usually manage the business yourself. Among its advantages a sole proprietorship is simple and inexpensive to set up, and simple from a tax standpoint—it’s part of your personal taxes. There are disadvantages to a sole proprietorship. Most importantly, you have unlimited personal liability—you are personally responsible for the business’ financial and legal liabilities. Profits will be taxed at your personal income tax rate, which is typically higher than a corporate tax rate.

A general partnership is more time consuming and expensive to set up and run than a sole proprietorship, but easier and less costly than a corporation.

There are two types of partner in a limited partnership—general and limited. The general partner manages day to day operations, and has unlimited liability. The limited partners are typically investors who do not have day-to-day management responsibilities. Their financial and legal liability is limited to the amount invested. The profits (or losses) are divided among the partners, with general partners usually earning a larger share. Partners report income and expenses on their own tax returns.
